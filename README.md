Yo this is my first Github Repo?

So basically you copy all these shit in to the ~/.config/(name of the directory)
voila thats it.

Its just an clean setup without doing toooo much.
It works very good on EndavourOS cuz you know I use it so it hast to be good(hopefully), but will probably fine on any arch(I use arch btw) distro. 
Its an mix of an youtube rofi config, random waybar config, my minimal changed alacritty and hyprland configs. So yeah nothing that Special tbh xd
For Questions just dm over Reddit -> Bl1ckHat(I created this name when I was 13 and didnt knew was black hat meant in cybersecurity) (I will respond too late probably but try it atleast).

Packages installed:

-hyprland (obviously)

-alacritty(best terminal emulator)

-nvim/astronvim [https://astronvim.com] (I really did not configure that cuz I cant even code(I just know how to make games and little bit of python but learning it. So if you wanna help also dm Reddit)just tweaked some stuff and looked up the documentations)

-rofi (way better than wofi or tofi)

-waybar (is pre-installed with hyprland(mostly))

If you really wanna use this as a starting point. Feel free to use it. Dont have to tag me or anything. Tho I'm curious what can you build on top of this lame setup xd.

Have fun? you will not cuz its arch and tiling wm.
